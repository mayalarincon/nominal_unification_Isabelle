# nominal_unification_Isabelle
This repository contains data of the project of updating Christian Urban's Isabelle formalisation of nominal syntactyc unification.  The original files are in the directory nomu. 


C. Urban's proposed steps:

- Step 1: Get the whole formalisation to compile again (should be easier now having SH)
- Step 2: Have a look at the equivalence proof (at the time it was a fiddly proof by cases....not sure whether SH can dispose of most of them). This would need to be eventually an Isar proof.
- Step 3: The unification algorithm is defined as a rewrite system following textbooks, but it should be defined as a function. This has been done with the simple first-order unification algorithm (in the AFP or main repo)
- Step 4: Some text
